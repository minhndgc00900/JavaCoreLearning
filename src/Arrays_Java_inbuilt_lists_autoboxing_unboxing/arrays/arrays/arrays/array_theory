Array:
- Is a data structure allows to store multiple values of the same type
into a single variable

- The default values of numeric array elements are set to "0";

- Arrays are zero indexed: an array with "n elements" is indexed from 0 to "n-1",
for example 10 elements index range is from 0-9;

- if we try to access that is out of range, java will give an
"ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException", which indicates that the index is out of range,
in other words out of bounds.

- To access array elements, we use square brace "[]", also known as access
operator

- "new" in "int[] arr = new int[5]" is used to create the array and initialise the
array elements to their default values

- int array elements would be initialized to "0"

- boolean array elements would be initialized to "false"

- for string or other objects, it would be "null"
